    <h3>About Atlanta Face Shields</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">About us, our goal, and our story</p>
    <div>
      <div>
        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>We are a group of Makers in and around the Atlanta area dedicated to produce protective face shields efficiently, effectively, and rapidly to provide local medical professionals with the protection they need during this pandemic.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Our Goal</h4>
        <p>Our goal is to prevent a ‘fast pandemic’ of the Covid-19 Virus, specifically in the Atlanta area. We have been working to make and ship the parts for these masks for use in Atlanta hospitals. We will assemble and deploy these masks in Atlanta hospitals and later across the country, once local needs have been met. </p>

        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <p>Atlanta Face Shields was founded by Max Seidel, a mechanical engineering student at Northeastern University. Max quickly brought on Nathan Eads, a mechanical engineer attending the University of Alabama. Both Max and Nathan have lucrative 3D printing and management experience.

    <h3>About the face shields</h3>
    <p class="subtitle">Prusa RC3 3D printed face shields</p>
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>We are using the Prusa 3D printable face shield design, which has been approved by the Czech Ministry of Health as a protective device against COVID-19.</p>
        <p>Each shield has three main components:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The plastic face shield</li>
          <li>The 3D printed frame</li>
          <li>The elastic band</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Hospitals can use their professional sterilizing equipment to properly sterilize (disinfect) these face shields between each use.</p>
