      <p><span>Hello Atlanta Face Shields Supporters, Friends, and Family,<br>
        <br>
        We are excited to share the following updates: <br>
        <br>
        First, we would like to thank two of our volunteers, Jack Buehner and Chris Haston for their teamwork in assembling our new website, AtlantaFaceShields.com. Secondly, we would also like to thank Laird Popkin and William Stryka for their ongoing tenacity, organization, and leadership, as well as our partners Tikkun Olam Makers for their fundraising efforts, Roswell Firelabs for their contributions, and all of the volunteers at Atlanta Beats Covid, our sister organization, for their continued efforts. <br>
        <br>
        Now for the numbers. We are excited to share the following shipments: <br>
           -Yesterday, we delivered two more batches, both to nurses on the front lines<br>
           -This afternoon, 20 gallons of isopropyl alcohol arrived at our facilities <br>
           -This evening, our volunteers will receive 320 face shields to be cut <br>
           -On April 7th, we will receive our first batch of 3D printer filament <br>
           -On April 9th we will receive a shipment of 100kg of 3D printer filament at a discounted price, courtesy of Taulman3D. <br>
        <br>
        As soon as we get these shipments in, we will be mobilizing our volunteers to start cranking out these shields. We want to thank you all again for your financial, emotional, and physical support. At this time, we have raised nearly $6,400 between GoFundMe and Tikkun Olam, and we are truly incapable of putting our full appreciation into writing.<br>
        <br>
        Our Sincerest Gratitude,<br>
        <br>

      <h4>April 1, 2020</h4>
      <p><span>4/1 Update:<br>
      <br>
      First off, we would like to share our utter amazement. When we decided to print some face shields for hospitals we never thought it would get this far. We were truly shocked this morning when I opened up GoFundMe to see donations from people we havenâ€™t seen in years. However, what was just as astonishing were all the names neither of us knew. We give our sincerest thank yous to all of you who have donated thus far. <br>
      <br>
      We posted an update yesterday including a new goal for 12,500 masks based on a huge shipment of the plastic we need for the face shields themselves. Unfortunately, the cost estimate we received today for this plastic would have increased the cost per mask by four dollars. We decided the most responsible thing we could do would be to refuse this offer. <br>
      <br>
      Part of this decision was based on the initial goal of our organization, which was to fill a temporary need until more efficient means of production becomes available. The time frame for that deployment is still very much a variable. Therefore, the timeline for demand of these masks is also unknown. <br>
      <br>
      This means we are no longer bound to the 12,500 count of masks giving us flexibility around the unknown that is our timeline meaning we can apply the funds we have collected in the most effective manner. However, we still see 12,500 as a very strong goal for our organization. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we have strengthened our bond with our sister organization, Atlanta Beats Covid. We are now leading a 3D printing task force with a few other volunteers to organize our combined efforts. This more established partnership will allow us to fully mobilize all of our combined efforts. We also recently received a large donation from another partner, Tikkun Olam Makers and wanted to thank them for their fundraising efforts and their continued support throughout this stressful time. <br>
      <br>
      As always, our first priority is transparency with the funds that have been graciously donated to us. We apologize for any misinformation, but are still aiming to hit that 12,500 mark. Please continue to share this as much as you can so we can continue to make as many masks as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your support, <br>
      <br>

      <h4>March 30, 2020</h4>
      <p><span>3/30 Update:<br>
      We hope you all are still doing well. We are excited to announce that we donated our first round of masks this morning. <br>
      <br>
      We are currently in the process of reaching out to doctors and nurses to explore what kinds of environments and cleaning methods these shields will be exposed to in order to hopefully expand our production materials and by extent our production volume.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we would like to note that any remaining funds from this effort will be first used to benefit our efforts, then our partners, and then if we have remaining funds, they will be donated to a local food bank or another similarly worthy cause.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your help thus far. Please do your best to stay safe. Staying in your homes will be boring, but those of you who are quarantining are the ones preventing the spread of COVID-19 which is, as you know, the most important goal we could have at this point. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your support,<br>

      <p><span>3/28 Update:<br>
      We got our first shipment of 30 shields in today. We are expecting a second shortly and are working hard to get prints moving locally. Thank you all again for your support. We will continue to update you to share how your donations are helping our cause. <br>

      Stay Safe,<br>
