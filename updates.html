        <span>Good Evening GoFundMe Supporters,<br>
          <br>
          After wrapping production on this week’s second build session, we crossed 2,000 face shields. As demand has begun to drop off, we have taken this week to fine tune our 3D printing settings to get the highest quality prints possible. We hope that  this will prepare us well for the inevitable second peak and subsequent demand caused by reopening the state. <br>
          <br>
          Additionally, we are now partnering with Clarkston Community Health Center to provide PPE to protect their staff at drive through testing events. This week we also donated roughly 20 face shields to the Sandy Springs Fire Department. To date we have now donated to the Atlanta Police department, Sandy Springs Fire, Piedmont, Grady, St. Joes, Atlanta Cancer Care, Emory, Coweta County Emergency Response, Medical College of Georgia, Vaccines2Go, as well as a slew of traveling nurses and local physicians. <br>
          <br>
          If you know of any other medical professionals who might need face shields, please refer them to the PPE request form on our website. That specific link can be found below. Although the form is prefered, if you experience trouble sharing that link, feel free to share our email address instead. <br>
          <br>
          We have also attached a timelapse of one of our recent build sessions, see the Google Drive link below to see our process. <br>
          <br>
          We thank you all for your continued support,<br>
          <br>

        <span>Hello Atlanta Face Shields Supporters,<br>
        <br>
        We hope you are staying safe! We just wrapped production on our second build session this week. We are excited to announce that we crossed 1,500 face shields and are currently over three times our initial goal! Thank you all for all your support, every share, like, and donation has been extremely helpful, not to mention all the well wishers! We really wouldn’t be here without you, but don’t fret, we aren’t done yet. We’re here as long as Corona is here. <br>
        <br>
        This week, we realized that even though we were super excited to get numbers to you all, we forgot to show you who these are going to. So, we have attached a Google Photos album at the bottom of this update so you can see our build process, all the way from when we were assembling in Max’s house up until now. You can also find some pictures of nurses receiving and using these shields. If you have any issues opening the album, we recommend you download the Google Photos mobile app. <br>
        <br>
        We have also ordered another 2,000 plastic face shields from our CNC contact, another 100 rolls of 3D printer filament, and more IPA. We have also been making connections around the city in hopes to expand our production soon. We hope that this expansion will put us on track to reach our long term goal of 12,500 total masks before the end of the pandemic. <br>
        <br>
        We also would like to remind everyone that just because the state is reopening next week, it is still wise to stay in quarantine, as much as possible. As seen historically with pandemics, a second wave is extremely likely, especially being that we haven’t reached the end of our first. We would really love for all of this to be over before we have a chance to hit 12,500 shields, and quarantine is the best shot we have at that. Thank you all for your continued support and daily bravery. This is a scary and stressful time for us all.<br>
        <br>
        Stay safe,<br>
        Nathan Eads and Max Seidel<br>

        <span>Good Samaritans, Friends, and Family,<br>
          <br>
          We are excited to share our report of the last week. We have almost completely distributed our first shipments of 3D printer filament. Our second shipment arrived last night and we are working hard to perfect our distribution methods to allocate it to our printer farms as quickly as possible. If you know anyone with a 3D printer, please have them reach out to us at atlantafaceshields@gmail.com. <br>
          <br>
          We also had our third official assembly day on Tuesday, April 14th. We are proud to announce that we produced just over 300 face shields. That is around 10 times what we produced the first build day with the same number of volunteers! This evening, April 16th, we held our fourth of these events and produced another 400 face shields. Our current estimates total around 850 shields. We are also exploring the possibility of expanding these assembly days to Saturdays at the good graces of Roswell Firelabs. If you are interested in coming to help, please sign up using this signup genius:<br>
          <br>
          <a href="https://www.signupgenius.com/go/9040b4ea5af22abf49-volunteer" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">https://www.signupgenius.com/go/9040b4ea5af22abf49-volunteer</a><br>
          <br>
          We have also made several new partnerships with local high schools who have generously offered their print farms to our effort. We have also perfected the hole spacing on our clear face shields and both of our CNC partners have been cutting these out for the last several days. <br>
          <br>
          As we become more and more busy with finals season approaching, we have had less time to devote to sharing updates.  Although we will continue to do so to honor your donations, please see our Instagram (@atlantafaceshields) for day-to-day updates and photos of our assembly events.<br>
          <br>
          Stay safe out there,<br>

      <h4>April 8, 2020</h4>
      <p>
        <span>Hello All,<br>
        <br>
        We are sorry for the long wait but we have a lot of new updates! First, we received a roll of 1,800 pounds of PETG sheets from the Coca Cola Company through Atlanta Beats Covid. This material has already been delivered to our partners who are in the process of cutting it into around 9,700 masks this week. We have worked with these partners to further lower our per unit cost. <br>
        <br>
        This Thursday, April 9th, we will receive 100 rolls of PETG 3D printer filament which will be swiftly distributed to our volunteers. We will be purchasing 200 more rolls of material as soon as we distribute this shipment. We also purchased 300 yards of button-hole elastic which will provide for the first 1000 face shields. We recently developed a more cost-effective solution using rubber bands and lasercut clips. <br>
        <br>
        You might have also noticed another increase in our funding goal. This increase will allow us to produce roughly 7,000 total face shields. We also are in the process of acquiring several corporate sponsorships to help us further bolster our production. <br>
        We now have an Instagram account where we will be posting more image related updates. Stay up to date with us there @atlantafaceshields. <br>
        Tuesday evening, we wrapped up our first large scale production day at Roswell Firelabs MakerSpace with the help of our volunteers: Haley Gruensfelder, Eemil Harkenon, Juliette &amp; Laird Popkin, William Strika, &amp; Ethan Wells. <br>
        <br>
        Due to the efforts of another one of our volunteers, Jack Buehner, medical staff should be able to access a form to request face shields on our website. Although we cannot get this delivered immediately, we want to go ahead and compile a distribution list. Please note that while we would love to help out of state medical groups, we need to focus first on the immediate Atlanta area and Georgia as a whole first.<br>
        <br>
        Finally, if you know anyone who would like to publish a story about Atlanta Face Shields please email us at contact@atlantafaceshields.com as this will help us get more eyes on the initiative as well as more funding!<br>
        <br>
        Stay home and stay healthy,<br>

      <h4>April 3, 2020</h4>
      <p><span>Hello Atlanta Face Shields Supporters, Friends, and Family,<br>
        <br>
        We are excited to share the following updates: <br>
        <br>
        First, we would like to thank two of our volunteers, Jack Buehner and Chris Haston for their teamwork in assembling our new website, AtlantaFaceShields.com. Secondly, we would also like to thank Laird Popkin and William Stryka for their ongoing tenacity, organization, and leadership, as well as our partners Tikkun Olam Makers for their fundraising efforts, Roswell Firelabs for their contributions, and all of the volunteers at Atlanta Beats Covid, our sister organization, for their continued efforts. <br>
        <br>
        Now for the numbers. We are excited to share the following shipments: <br>
           -Yesterday, we delivered two more batches, both to nurses on the front lines<br>
           -This afternoon, 20 gallons of isopropyl alcohol arrived at our facilities <br>
           -This evening, our volunteers will receive 320 face shields to be cut <br>
           -On April 7th, we will receive our first batch of 3D printer filament <br>
           -On April 9th we will receive a shipment of 100kg of 3D printer filament at a discounted price, courtesy of Taulman3D. <br>
        <br>
        As soon as we get these shipments in, we will be mobilizing our volunteers to start cranking out these shields. We want to thank you all again for your financial, emotional, and physical support. At this time, we have raised nearly $6,400 between GoFundMe and Tikkun Olam, and we are truly incapable of putting our full appreciation into writing.<br>
        <br>
        Our Sincerest Gratitude,<br>

      <h4>April 1, 2020</h4>
      <p><span>
      First off, we would like to share our utter amazement. When we decided to print some face shields for hospitals we never thought it would get this far. We were truly shocked this morning when I opened up GoFundMe to see donations from people we haven’t seen in years. However, what was just as astonishing were all the names neither of us knew. We give our sincerest thank yous to all of you who have donated thus far. <br>
      <br>
      We posted an update yesterday including a new goal for 12,500 masks based on a huge shipment of the plastic we need for the face shields themselves. Unfortunately, the cost estimate we received today for this plastic would have increased the cost per mask by four dollars. We decided the most responsible thing we could do would be to refuse this offer. <br>
      <br>
      Part of this decision was based on the initial goal of our organization, which was to fill a temporary need until more efficient means of production becomes available. The time frame for that deployment is still very much a variable. Therefore, the timeline for demand of these masks is also unknown. <br>
      <br>
      This means we are no longer bound to the 12,500 count of masks giving us flexibility around the unknown that is our timeline meaning we can apply the funds we have collected in the most effective manner. However, we still see 12,500 as a very strong goal for our organization. <br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we have strengthened our bond with our sister organization, Atlanta Beats Covid. We are now leading a 3D printing task force with a few other volunteers to organize our combined efforts. This more established partnership will allow us to fully mobilize all of our combined efforts. We also recently received a large donation from another partner, Tikkun Olam Makers and wanted to thank them for their fundraising efforts and their continued support throughout this stressful time. <br>
      <br>
      As always, our first priority is transparency with the funds that have been graciously donated to us. We apologize for any misinformation, but are still aiming to hit that 12,500 mark. Please continue to share this as much as you can so we can continue to make as many masks as possible.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your support, <br>
      <br>

      <h4>March 30, 2020</h4>
      <p><span>We hope you all are still doing well. We are excited to announce that we donated our first round of masks this morning. <br>
      <br>
      We are currently in the process of reaching out to doctors and nurses to explore what kinds of environments and cleaning methods these shields will be exposed to in order to hopefully expand our production materials and by extent our production volume.<br>
      <br>
      Additionally, we would like to note that any remaining funds from this effort will be first used to benefit our efforts, then our partners, and then if we have remaining funds, they will be donated to a local food bank or another similarly worthy cause.<br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your help thus far. Please do your best to stay safe. Staying in your homes will be boring, but those of you who are quarantining are the ones preventing the spread of COVID-19 which is, as you know, the most important goal we could have at this point. <br>
      <br>
      Thank you all for your support,<br>
